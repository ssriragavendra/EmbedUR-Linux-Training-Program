# 1. Create a file and add executable permission to all users (user, group and others)
	
	touch task1.txt
	chmod a+x task1.txt

# 2. Create a file and remove write permission for group user alone.
	
	touch task2.txt
	chmod g-w task2.txt

# 3. Create a file and add a softlink to the file in different directory (Eg : Create a file in dir1/dir2/file and create a softlink for file inside dir1)
	
	mkdir -p dir1/dir2
	touch dir1/dir2/file
	ln -s dir2/file dir1/mysink

# 4. Use ps command with options to display all active process running on the system
	
	ps -ux or ps -ef (Both the commands give the same answer)

# 5. Create 3 files in a dir1 and re-direct the output of list command with sorted by timestamp of the files to a file

	mkdir -p dir1
	touch dir1/a.txt dir1/b.txt dir1/c.txt
	ls -lt dir1 > output.txt
