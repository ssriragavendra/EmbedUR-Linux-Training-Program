I have written a bash script which takes the file as input goes through it line by line and generates the output file (output.txt) with listings of following parameters fetched from the input file.
 "frame.time", "wlan.fc.type", "wlan.fc.subtype"

I have written the filtering code in Answer_script.sh
 
I have attached the Compressed input and output files for verification.
