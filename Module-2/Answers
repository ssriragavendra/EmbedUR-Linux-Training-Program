# 1) Use the appropriate command to list all files larger than 1 MB in the current directory and save the output to a file.
	
	find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size +1M > large_files.txt
	
	# Verification: 
		cat large_files.txt

# 2) Replace all occurrences of "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in a configuration file named config.txt, and save the updated file as updated_config.txt.
	
	sed 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/g' config.txt > updated_config.txt

	# Verification:
		cat updated_config.txt

# 3) Use the appropriate command to search for lines containing the word "ERROR" in a log file but exclude lines containing "DEBUG". Save the results to a file named filtered_log.txt.

	awk '/ERROR/ && !/DEBUB/' logfile.log > filtered_log.txt

	# Verification:
		cat filtered_log.txt

# 4) Write a code to identify the process with the highest memory usage and then terminate it.


	ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 1
	top
	kill 5764

	# Verification:
		The most memory consuming process will get stopped or exited.

# 5) Use the networking tool command and print all the gateway available in a sorted manner
	
	ip route
	netstat -rn
	ip route show | grep default | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u

	# Verification:
		Now all the gateway availabe is printed in a sorted manner
